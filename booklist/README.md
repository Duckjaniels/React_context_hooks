## General Information

- The project is divided into 3 smaller ones:

1. hooksapp - simple app that add songs to the list; made to train use of React Hooks.
2. contextapp - this app was made as a "training field" for use of React Context. It allows user to change the theme of
   the application on button.
3. booklist - main app that combines all of the techniques used in previous apps. This one specifically is made as a
   notebook in which we can add books titles and author names as well as delete ones. Then we get information how many
   books we still have to read or that we have read all of them. The data of books is saving in local storage, so it
   doesn't disappear after site refreshing. At the end I added bookReducer component to improve appearance and
   optimization of the code.
